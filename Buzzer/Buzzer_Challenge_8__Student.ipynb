    "Create a countdown timer using the buzzer. The buzzer should beep once per second for 10 seconds. After the countdown is complete, it should play a final long beep to indicate time is up.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1⃣ Use a Loop to Control Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a `for` loop to repeat the buzzer sound 10 times (once per second).\n",
    "- Use `time.sleep(1)` to create the delay between each beep.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2⃣ Play a Short Beep\n",
    "\n",
    "- Call the buzzer function inside the loop.\n",
    "- Use an appropriate frequency for a short beep.\n",
    "- Adjust the `on_time` and `off_time` to ensure the beep is clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3⃣ Play a Final Long Beep\n",
    "\n",
    "- After the loop finishes, play one final beep that is longer than the previous beeps.\n",
    "- Choose a different frequency to make it distinguishable.\n",
